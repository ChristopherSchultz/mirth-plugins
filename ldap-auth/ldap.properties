# For example, a user Mirth user "mary" has an LDAP username of "mjones".
# Mary wants to login to Mirth with "mary" but needs to authenticate with
# the LDAP server as "mjones", so you map "mary=mjones".
#
# Mapped usernames are separated by commas, you can escape a comma with a
# backslash. Usernames are mapped with an equals sign, you can escape an =
# with a backslash as well.
